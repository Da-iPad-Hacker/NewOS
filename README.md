Microsoft Windows BSD Edition
-

Welcome to the world of Microsoft Windows BSD Edition!

What is Microsoft Windows BSD Edition?
--------------------------------------
Microsoft Windows BSD Edition is a unix-based Microsoft Windows clone. It aims to improve stability and revive Windows 10. The reason is, do we really want PCs that work COMPLETELY FINE to go to waste? of course not! Yeah, we already have the pretty much failed ReactOS project, and we have the successful Linux with Wine, but that is simply not enough. Lots of you who are already familiar with Windows 10 are in luck, because this project aims to be almost exactly like Windows 10. So, let's delve deeper.

What does it do?
----------------
This project uses KDE plasma, WINE, and quite a few other peices of handy, open-source software that you don't get on normal Microsoft Windows.

Where is the project up to right now?
-------------------------------------
Well, Microsoft Windows BSD edition has only just started development, so don't expect the full release for another year. If y'all don't nag me, then the project could be completely finished in a couple of months. 2 versions are planned to be released: WinBSD, which uses KDE plazma, and requires quite a bit, and then there is WinBSD Lite, which uses LXQt, and only requires 1-2gb of RAM. Please note that feature optimizations could take a wile for the Lite version, so that might take longer than the standard WinBSD release, but please note that I am doing my best.

What is the planned release date?
---------------------------------
As of Febuary 8 2026, there isn't a planned release date. However, updates are coming out on the Discord server, so if you want updates, please make sure to check the Discord server. The full WinEvent is expected to come out in the second half of 2026, so just know that the full release ain't coming out any time soon, and ALSO just know that when it DOES come out, it will hopefully have a huge blow on the market.

What's the price????
--------------------
So, when you think of Microsoft Windows, you think 'oh, shit! I have to pay $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$!'. Well, you might be thinking, 'how do I pay for this new unix-based Windows?'. That's the neat part, you don't. So, good news, everybody! WinBSD is...drum roll please..................FREE! Yeah! That's right! No fees! And, plus, no cap! I'm telling the truth! No cap! It's all open source, so that means no hidden fees, no gengar coming at you and sucking your money out of your wallet, because it is FREE! FREE FOR ALL! Except you do have to pay for one thing........a computer!

So, what did we learn from that?
--------------------------------
We learned that WinBSD is a unix-based Windows clone that is 10x better than the real Microsoft Windows! It's free, much more stable, and....you can also run native apps right out of the box!!!!!!!!!!! See ya later!
